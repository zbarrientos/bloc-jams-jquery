# bloc-jams-jquery

The main challenge for this project was to refactor an existing code base using jQuery. 
The completed app needed to be a fully interactive, functional music player that fulfilled a list of user stories relating to information display and music control functionality

Specifically, the app needed to be re-coded to accomplish the following:
1. Display album information
2. Display the songs and song length in list form
3. Include standard music controls for playing, pausing, skipping forward/backward and adjusting the volume.
